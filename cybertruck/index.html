              <h3>EXOSKELETON</h3>
              <p>
                Cybertruck is built with an exterior shell made for ultimate
                durability and passenger protection. Starting with a nearly
                impenetrable exoskeleton, every component is designed for
                superior strength and endurance, from Ultra-Hard 30X Cold-Rolled
                stainless-steel structural skin to Tesla armor glass.

                provides you and your passengers maximum protection.

          <p class="del">
            With up to 3,500 pounds of payload capacity and adjustable air
            suspension, Cybertruck is the most powerful tool we have ever built,
            engineered with 100 cubic feet of exterior, lockable storage —
            including a magic tonneau cover that is strong enough to stand on.

          <h2>VAULT-LIKE STORAGE</h2>
          <p>
            Space for your toolbox, tire and Cyberquad, with room to spare.
            Utilize 100 cubic feet of exterior, lockable storage — including the
            under-bed, frunk and sail pillars.
